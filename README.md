# A New Life - Single

**A New Life** is a music single that consists of 2 tracks:

- Human Migration. It uses aircraft altitude and speed data to generate the melody.
- Tallinn In December. It uses real-time hourly weather forecast data of Tallinn generate the melody.

The JavaScript code will generate MIDI data and send it to DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) in real-time to control my Korg Kross 2 synthesizer. After that, the synthesizer will send back the audio to the DAW, and the DAW will record it as an audio track.
